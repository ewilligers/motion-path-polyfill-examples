This repo contains a variety of web pages that use the [CSS Motion Path](https://drafts.fxtf.org/motion-1/) and [Individual Transform](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-2/#individual-transforms) properties.

They have been tested in Firefox, using the [Motion Path Polyfill](https://github.com/Motion-Path-Polyfill/motion-path-js).
